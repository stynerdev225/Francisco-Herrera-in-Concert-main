# Form Submission Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides detailed information about the form submission process and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Recent Changes

We've made several improvements to the form submission process to address issues with form submissions not working:

1. **Improved Form Submission in hero-section.tsx**:
   - Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging
   - Added a mechanism to reset any scrolling flags that might interfere with form submission

2. **Fixed Scrolling Interference in marketing-section.tsx**:
   - Modified the scrolling functionality to not interfere with form elements
   - Reduced the scrolling lock time from 2.5 seconds to 1 second
   - Added checks to prevent scrolling functions from capturing form interactions

3. **Created Test Tools**:
   - `direct-form-test.html`: A standalone page to test form submissions directly
   - `test-form.html`: A simple form that submits to the Google Apps Script

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Form Submission Not Working

If the form submission is not working, try the following:

- **Use the Alternative Submission Method**: Click the "If submission doesn't work, click here to try direct page redirect method" link below the form.
- **Check Console for Errors**: Open the browser console (F12) and look for any error messages.
- **Try the Direct Form Test**: Open `direct-form-test.html` in your browser and test the form submission directly.

### 2. Scrolling Interference

If scrolling functionality is interfering with form submission:

- **Wait a Few Seconds**: The scrolling lock is now set to 1 second, so wait a moment before trying to submit the form.
- **Click Directly on Form Elements**: The form elements should now be excluded from scrolling interference.
- **Refresh the Page**: If all else fails, refresh the page and try again.

### 3. Google Apps Script Issues

If the form is submitting but data is not appearing in the Google Sheet:

- **Check the Script URL**: Ensure the correct script URL is being used.
- **Check the Google Sheet**: Make sure the Google Sheet exists and has the correct columns.
- **Test with Direct URL**: Use the direct URL method in `direct-form-test.html` to test the Google Apps Script directly.

## Testing the Form

You can test the form submission in several ways:

1. **Using the Website Form**: Fill out and submit the form on the website.
2. **Using the Alternative Method**: Click the "If submission doesn't work..." link below the form.
3. **Using the Test Tools**:
   - Open `direct-form-test.html` to test different submission methods.
   - Open `test-form.html` for a simple form test.
4. **Direct URL Testing**: Use a URL with query parameters like:

   ```plaintext
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzH8pRKDN-e5yJoSYVKGn_iABHj0lzIbpi-rDvrnNedNLDuovy-SQJ0QTwUzNmukEjk/exec?firstName=Test&lastName=User&email=test@example.com&phone=123456789&message=TestMessage
   ```

## Technical Details

### Form Submission Process

1. **User Fills Out Form**: The user enters their information in the form.
2. **Form Validation**: The form is validated to ensure required fields are filled.
3. **Form Submission**:
   - A temporary form is created in the DOM
   - The form is submitted using the GET method to the Google Apps Script URL
   - If the primary method fails, fallback methods are attempted
4. **Google Apps Script Processing**:
   - The script receives the form data
   - The data is saved to the Google Sheet
   - A success response is returned
5. **UI Update**: The form is reset and a success message is displayed.

### Scrolling Functionality

The scrolling functionality in `marketing-section.tsx` has been modified to:

1. **Detect Form Elements**: Check if the clicked element is a form element or inside a form.
2. **Reduce Lock Time**: The scrolling lock time has been reduced from 2.5 seconds to 1 second.
3. **Add Data Attributes**: Data attributes are added to the body to indicate scrolling state.
4. **Reset Flags**: Flags are reset after scrolling is complete.
